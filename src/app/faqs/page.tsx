This includes former employees of the Oyo State Civil Service, teachers, and other government workers who have completed their service and are entitled to pension payments."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "What information do I need to register?",
    answer: "To register, you'll need your Pension ID number, National Identification Number (NIN), full name as it appears on official documents, date of birth, email address, phone number, and residential address. You'll also need to provide details about your employment history including date of first appointment, date of retirement, and current pension scheme type."

  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "How is the verification done?",
    answer: "The verification process involves multiple steps: First, your personal information is cross-referenced with government records.

Finally, your pension details are validated against the state's pension database to ensure accuracy."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "What if face verification fails?",
    answer: "If face verification fails, don't worry. You can try uploading a clearer, more recent photograph. Ensure the photo is well-lit, shows your full face clearly, and matches your official identification. If the issue persists, you can contact our support team for assistance or schedule an in-person verification appointment."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "Is my data safe?",
    answer: "Yes, your data is completely safe. We use industry-standard encryption to protect all personal information.

Your information is only accessible to authorized personnel and is never shared with third parties without your consent."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "Can I use the system on my phone?",
    answer: "Absolutely! The Virtual Pension Verification System is fully responsive and works perfectly on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers. You can access all features including registration, login, document upload, and verification from any device with an internet connection."
